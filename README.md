# file-controller
An operator to make sure a given list of file in given directory exists (create them when not exists).

## Description
This operator watches `dirfiles.files.felinae98.cn` resource, and track files in `dir` and create file in `files`. For example,
```yaml
apiVersion: file.felinae98.cn/v1
kind: DirFile
metadata:
  name: dirfile-sample
spec:
  dir: /tmp/a
  files:
    - file1
    - file4
```
the operator will track files in `/tmp/a`, and make sure `/tmp/a/file1` and `/tmp/a/file2` exists. And the status of this resource shows the files in `/tmp/a` of each node.

Assume that you have a cluster with two nodes, the `status` of `dirfile` resource will show as follows:
```yaml
Status:
  Exsiting Files:
    k8s-node1: # <- node name
      file1 # <- file name of files in `/tmp/a` in k8s-node1
      file4
    k8s-node2:
      file1
      file4
      t1 # additional file in k8s-node2
```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Basic Usage

1. Install DaemonSet

**Note**: The DaemonSet is not controlled by operator, you must make sure the DaemonSet was applied before install instances of cr.

```sh
kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
```

2. Install Custom Resource Definition

```sh
make install
```

3. Run Operator Locally

```sh
make run
```

4. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

### Publish or Deploy to Cluster

Please refer to kubebuiler documentation for further information.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
